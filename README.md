# Sheets-clone-vue

Sheets-clone-vue is a  my attempt to recreate a simple sheets clone using, vue.js. 

It is a bare-bones project, but with all the parts in working condition. 

Vue-router has enabled routing, Pinia for state management. 
The backend is supported by supabase, with features like file creation, deletion, renaming a file and authentication.
Although the supabase shuts-down a project after 7 days of inactivity, it can be brought up back again.
